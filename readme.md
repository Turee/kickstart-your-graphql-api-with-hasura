# Kickstart your GraphQL API with Hasura.

## TL;DR;

Hasura can accelerate backend development by automating the implementation of simple CRUD endpoints. Business logic can still be implemented using remote schemas, webhooks and database triggers/functions.

## Introduction

Software projects are all about using your available development time most efficiently. In this post we are going to explore how we can save time on our backend endpoints by using Hasura GraphQL engine. We will do this by implementing a backend system for our fictional pizzeria. Finally, we will discuss the implementation.

The code found in this post can be also found from [here](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura). I will referer to files found in the repository later. If you want to run the code examples you will need [hasura cli](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/hasura-cli/index.html#installation), [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

## Requirements

Our requirements for the pizzeria-api are as follows:

- Allow customers place orders.
- Allow customers to receive updates to their order.
- Employees must have a dashboard where they can see a list of all active orders. Dashboard must be real time.

## Implementation

We will use Hasura GraphQL engine for the API implementation. To do this we will do the following:

1. Create a PostgreSQL **database**
2. Define some Hasura **metadata**
3. Implement a micro service using NodeJS and use Hasura's **remote schema** feature

### Database

The database will be used to save all of our data. We will define the database with following script:

```sql
CREATE TABLE topping (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE pizza (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price MONEY NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE pizza_topping (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pizza_id BIGINT REFERENCES pizza(id),
    topping_id BIGINT REFERENCES topping(id)
);
CREATE INDEX ON pizza_topping(pizza_id);
CREATE INDEX ON pizza_topping(topping_id);

CREATE TABLE order_status (
    status TEXT PRIMARY KEY
);

INSERT INTO order_status (status) VALUES ('NEW');
INSERT INTO order_status (status) VALUES ('RECEIVED');
INSERT INTO order_status (status) VALUES ('IN_PROGRESS');
INSERT INTO order_status (status) VALUES ('READY');

CREATE TABLE "order" (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW (),
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    pizza JSONB NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES order_status(status)
);
CREATE INDEX ON "order"(status);
```

The migration file is located in the `migrations` directory of the example code. You can apply the migration by using following command:

```
hasura migrate apply
```

### Hasura metadata

Hasura metadata contains following information:

- Tracked tables
- Tracked relations
- Authorization rules
- Remote schemas
- Webhook event handlers

**Table tracking** means that Hasura will generate a GraphQL schema for the table that contains CRUD operations.

**Relationship tracking** means that you can navigate the relations using the GraphQL schema. For example you might have a field called "toppings" in the pizza-type that when queried returns all the toppings related to the pizza.

With **authorization rules** you can define role based access control for invidual columns. Rules can be either static or dynamic. Static rules just allow/deny access to specific columns. Dynamic rules allow/deny access based on an expression, for example if `user_id` column matches value of `x-hasura-user-id` header the access is granted.

**Remote schemas** are GraphQL schemas that can be [stitched](https://blog.hasura.io/the-ultimate-guide-to-schema-stitching-in-graphql-f30178ac0072/) to the main schema. This will allow you to implement custom GraphQL types for your specific needs.

**Webhook event handlers** allow you to add an endpoint that Hasura will call when something happens in the database.

### Table tracking

Let's instruct Hasura to track all tables by clicking "add all" .

Next thing to do is to add relationship tracking information for each table:

![](relations.png)

### Authentication

Before we move to authorization, let's setup a quick authentication mechanism by using Let's use [Auth0](https://Auth0.com/).

Hasura has an excellent [tutorial](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/guides/integrations/auth0-jwt.html) for setting up Auth0. But for the impatient below is the TL;DR; version of the tutorial:

1. Create auth0 account, tenant and application.
2. Use [this tool](https://hasura.io/jwt-config) to create a JWT config.
3. Pass the JWT config as environment variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` as seen in the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) .

### Authorization rules

After setting up authentication we are going to implement some access control. We will do this by adding the authorization metadata using Hasura console.

Our goal is to implement following access control for the `user` role:

- User can see all the pizzas and toppings
- User can see his own orders

First, let's give the user permission to select his own orders. We will add a custom check that will validate that the `user_id` in the database row will match the `x-hasura-user-id` header.
![](order_select.png)

Next, let's allow the user to select all pizzas and toppings (he probably wants to see a menu):
![](pizza_select.png)
![](pizza_topping_select.png)
![](topping_select.png)

### Remote schema

We could allow the user to insert orders to the database. and have Hasura to save the value of `x-hasura-user-id` header to order's `user_id` column and that would be it.

But in the real world we want to execute some business logic when the user places an order. Such business logic can be sending emails, notifications, processing payments and such.

I have implemented a simple NodeJS application which exposes a single GraphQL mutation called `createOrder`. We can glue the schema to the Hasura schema using Hasura's "Remote Schemas" feature:

![](remote_schema.png)

The NodeJS application now handles the `createOrder` mutation. Also, we have a place where we can implement all the business logic we want.

You can find the source code for the NodeJS application [here](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura/tree/master/services/order).

### Versioning the metadata

At this point you might be thinking that we just saved a bunch of data into a database. How are we going to promote these changes from one environment to another?

We can export the Hasura metadata by using following command:

```
hasura metadata export
```

This generates [a file](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura/blob/master/migrations/metadata.yaml) that contains all the metadata about the database. We can add this file to our Git repository which means that our metadata is now under version control ðŸŽ‰.

When we are ready to promote our metadata changes to another environment, we can do this with following command:

```
hasura metadata apply
```

## Trying it out

Let's try out our API. First we need to add some data to the database though:

```sql
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Mozzarella cheese');
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (2, 'Provolone cheese');
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (3, 'Pepperoni');
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (4, 'Mushrooms');
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (5, 'Marinara sauce');
SELECT setval('topping_id_seq', (SELECT max(id) FROM topping));

INSERT INTO pizza (id, name, price) VALUES (1, 'Pepperoni', 11);
INSERT INTO pizza (id, name, price) VALUES (2, 'Margherita', 9);
SELECT setval('pizza_id_seq', (SELECT max(id) FROM pizza));

INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 2);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 3);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 4);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 5);

INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (2, 1);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (2, 5);
```

Now we can use a GraphQL client to list the pizzas with following query (using user's credentials):

![](list_pizzas.png)

Insert orders and watch changes to them!

Looks like our API is ready for the frontend team ðŸ˜Ž.

## Discussion

We implemented the backend with relative ease. Let's discuss a couple of points that might affect your decision to use Hasura.

**Performance**

As a backend engineer you are probably little worried how your system will perform under load. With Hasura you need to take following into account:

- Hasura is [fast](https://blog.hasura.io/architecture-of-a-high-performance-graphql-to-sql-server-58d9944b8a87).
- You can scale Hasura horizontally (subscriptions are implemented by watching database tables directly).
- Only limitation is the performance of your PostgreSQL instance. Yet, you need to have _a lot_ of concurrent users to saturate a single PostgreSQL instance on modern hardware.

**Business logic**

You still have to implement some business logic in your backend. With Hasura you have following options:

1.  **Database triggers and functions.** You can implement business logic at some level directly into the database. However, with this option you are limited to the pretty verbose [PL/pgSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/pgSQL) programming language by default.

    It seems that there are couple of programming language extension for Postgres: [plv8](https://github.com/plv8/plv8) V8 javascript engine, [pgmoon](https://github.com/leafo/pgmoon) and [PL/Java](https://tada.github.io/pljava/). These solutions will probably have their own limitations.

2.  **Webhook callbacks.** In Hasura, it's possible to add [webhooks](https://hasura.io/event-triggers) that react to database events. This allows you to do some async business logic like sending notifications or updating search indices. You can use [subscriptions](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/subscriptions/index.html) to keep the client up to date.

    We could have used this pattern in our pizza-api as well. We could have added a webhook callback to our microservice, which would have updated the database row (ie. payment status). Client would have received the update through a GraphQL subscription.

3.  **GraphQL Schema Stitching.** This is what we used in the example. This approach allows full control of the endpoint implementation. You can for example return an error if some side effect fails.

Ofcourse, you don't have to stick with one of these solutions. You can combine them and use the solution that feels the least awkward.

## Conclusion

I have thought about using some kind of CRUD generator in my backend stacks for a while. Hasura feels like a solid choice for accelerating your backend development. It has a solid code base written with Haskell (which i'm fan of). Haskell focuses on correctness and performance, which are assets when implementing something like Hasura.

Hasura definitely has it's uses in my future backend stacks. Nobody enjoys writing simple CRUD endpoints after all. Also, i'm sure that our clients will appreciate not having to pay for work that can be automated.
