# Kickstart your GraphQL API with Hasura.

## TL;DR;

Hasura can accelerate backend development by automating the implementation of simple CRUD endpoints. Business logic can still be implemented using remote schemas, webhooks and database triggers/functions.

## Introduction

Software projects are all about using your available development time most efficiently. In this post we are going to explore how we can save time on our backend endpoints by using Hasura GraphQL engine. We will do this by implementing a backend system for our fictional pizzeria. Finally, we will discuss the implementation.

The code found in this post can be also found from [here](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura). I will referer to files found in the repository later. If you want to run the code examples you will need [hasura cli](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/hasura-cli/index.html#installation), [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

## Requirements

Our requirements for the pizzeria-api are as follows:

- Allow customers place orders.
- Allow customers to receive updates to their order.
- Employees must have a dashboard where they can see a list of all active orders. Dashboard must be real time.

## Implementation

Let's start by firing up the system found in the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura/blob/master/docker-compose.yml). Next, let's migrate the database found in the [migration file](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura/blob/master/migrations/1547751385993_initial-tables.up.sql):

```sql
CREATE TABLE topping (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE pizza (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price MONEY NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE pizza_topping (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pizza_id BIGINT REFERENCES pizza(id),
    topping_id BIGINT REFERENCES topping(id)
);
CREATE INDEX ON pizza_topping(pizza_id);
CREATE INDEX ON pizza_topping(topping_id);

CREATE TABLE order_status (
    status TEXT PRIMARY KEY
);

INSERT INTO order_status (status) VALUES ('NEW');
INSERT INTO order_status (status) VALUES ('RECEIVED');
INSERT INTO order_status (status) VALUES ('IN_PROGRESS');
INSERT INTO order_status (status) VALUES ('READY');

CREATE TABLE "order" (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW (),
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    pizza JSONB NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES order_status(status)
);
CREATE INDEX ON "order"(status);
```

Execute the migrations by using Hasura CLI:

```
hasura migrate apply
```

### Hasura metadata

Next, we are going to add some Hasura metadata using the Hasura console. First thing to do is to add tracking information for the tables by clicking "Add all":

Hasura just generated a GraphQL CRUD API for us with subscriptions support. See all Hasura features [here](https://hasura.io/all-features).

Next thing to do is to add relationship tracking information for each table:

![](relations.png)

We can use following command to export our metadata:

```
hasura metadata export
```

This generates [a file](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura/blob/master/migrations/metadata.yaml) that contains all the metadata about the database.

I like to add this file and related database changes in the git repository. This enables us to apply our changes to another environment later.

We apply this metadata using following command:

```
hasura metadata apply
```

### Authentication

Let's use [Auth0](https://Auth0.com/) to get our user authentication/signup working.

Hasura has an excellent [tutorial](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/guides/integrations/auth0-jwt.html) for setting up Auth0. But for the impatient below is the TL;DR; version of the tutorial:

1. Create auth0 account, tenant and application.
2. Use [this tool](https://hasura.io/jwt-config) to create a JWT config.
3. Pass the JWT config as environment variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` as seen in the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) .

That was simple enough ðŸ˜….

### Authorization

Next we are going to implement some access control. We don't want to allow users modify another user's orders for example, that would be bad. We are going to do this by using Hasura console to generate the required metadata.

First, let's give the user permission to select his own orders. We will add a custom check that will validate that the `user_id` in the database row will match the `x-hasura-user-id` header.
![](order_select.png)

Next, let's allow the user to select all pizzas and toppings (he probably wants to see a menu):
![](pizza_select.png)
![](pizza_topping_select.png)
![](topping_select.png)

### Order service

We could allow the user to insert orders to the database. and have Hasura to save the value of `x-hasura-user-id` header to order's `user_id` column and that would be it.

But in the real world we want to execute some business logic when the user places an order. Such business logic can be sending emails, notifications, processing payments and such.

I have implemented a simple NodeJS application which exposes a single GraphQL mutation called `createOrder`. We can glue the schema to the Hasura schema using Hasura's "Remote Schemas" feature:

![](remote_schema.png)

The NodeJS application now handles the `createOrder` mutation. Also, we have a place where we can implement all the business logic we want.

You can find the source code for the NodeJS application [here](https://github.com/Turee/kickstart-your-graphql-api-with-hasura/tree/master/services/order).

## Trying it out

Let's add some pizzas:

```sql
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Mozzarella cheese');
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (2, 'Provolone cheese');
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (3, 'Pepperoni');
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (4, 'Mushrooms');
INSERT INTO topping (id, name) VALUES (5, 'Marinara sauce');
SELECT setval('topping_id_seq', (SELECT max(id) FROM topping));

INSERT INTO pizza (id, name, price) VALUES (1, 'Pepperoni', 11);
INSERT INTO pizza (id, name, price) VALUES (2, 'Margherita', 9);
SELECT setval('pizza_id_seq', (SELECT max(id) FROM pizza));

INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 2);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 3);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 4);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (1, 5);

INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (2, 1);
INSERT INTO pizza_topping (pizza_id, topping_id) VALUES (2, 5);
```

Now we can list pizzas with following query (using user's credentials):

![](list_pizzas.png)

Insert orders and watch changes to them!

## Discussion

We implemented the backend with relative ease. Let's discuss a couple of points we need to take into account:

**Performance**

- Hasura is [fast](https://blog.hasura.io/architecture-of-a-high-performance-graphql-to-sql-server-58d9944b8a87).
- You can scale horizontally (subscriptions are implemented by watching database tables directly).
- Only limitation is the performance of your PostgreSQL instance. Yet, you need to have _a lot_ of concurrent users to saturate a single PostgreSQL instance on modern hardware.

**Business logic**

You still have to implement some business logic in your backend. With Hasura you have following options:

1.  **Database triggers and functions.** You can implement business logic at some level directly into the database. However, with this option you are limited to the pretty verbose [PL/pgSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/pgSQL) programming language by default.

    It seems that there are couple of programming language extension for Postgres: [plv8](https://github.com/plv8/plv8) V8 javascript engine, [pgmoon](https://github.com/leafo/pgmoon) and [PL/Java](https://tada.github.io/pljava/). These solutions will probably have their own limitations.

2.  **Webhook callbacks.** In Hasura, it's possible to add [webhooks](https://hasura.io/event-triggers) that react to database events. This allows you to do some async business logic like sending notifications and updating search indices, etc. You can even use [Hasura subscriptions](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/subscriptions/index.html) to listen for changes. We could have used this pattern in our pizza-api as well. We could have added a webhook callback to our microservice, which would have updated the database row (ie. payment status). Client would have received the update through a GraphQL subscription.

3.  **GraphQL Schema Stitching.** This is what we used in the example. This approach allows full control of the endpoint implementation. You can for example return an error if some side effect fails.

Ofcourse, you don't have to stick with one of these solutions. You can combine them and use the solution that feels the least awkward.

## Conclusion

I have thought about using some kind of CRUD generator in my backend stacks for a while. Hasura feels like a solid choice for accelerating your backend development. It has a solid code base written with Haskell (which i'm fan of). Haskell focuses on correctness, which will be an asset when implementing something like Hasura.

Hasura definitely has it's uses in my future backend stacks. Nobody enjoys writing simple CRUD endpoints after all. I'm sure our clients will appreciate for not having to pay for work that can be automated.

Added bonus is that you get to watch changes in the database using GraphQL subscriptions. This makes implementing real time apps a breeze!
